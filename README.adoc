* https://github.com/sunilsoni/Codility-Practice/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codility/lessons/Sorting/Distinct.java[*Distinct:*] Compute number of distinct values in an array.


Write a function

[source,java]
-----------------
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
-----------------

that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct values in array A.

Assume that::

N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].
For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:
[source,java]
-----------------
 A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
 A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1
-----------------
the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.

Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).


* https://github.com/sunilsoni/Codility-Practice/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codility/lessons/Sorting/Triangle.java[*Triangle:*] Determine whether a triangle can be built from a given set of edges.

A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A triplet (P, Q, R) is triangular if 0 ≤ P < Q < R < N and:
[source,java]
-----------------
A[P] + A[Q] > A[R],
A[Q] + A[R] > A[P],
A[R] + A[P] > A[Q].
-----------------
For example, consider array A such that:
[source,java]
-----------------
  A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 20
-----------------
Triplet (0, 2, 4) is triangular.

Write a function:
[source,java]
-----------------
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
-----------------

that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns 1 if there exists a triangular triplet for this array and returns 0 otherwise.

For example, given array A such that:
[source,java]
-----------------
  A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 20
-----------------
the function should return 1, as explained above. Given array A such that:
[source,java]
-----------------
  A[0] = 10    A[1] = 50    A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1
-----------------
the function should return 0.

Assume that::

N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).


* https://github.com/sunilsoni/Codility-Practice/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codility/lessons/Sorting/MaxProductOfThree.java[*MaxProductOfThree:*] Maximize A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] for any triplet (P, Q, R).

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. The product of triplet (P, Q, R) equates to A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] (0 ≤ P < Q < R < N).

For example, array A such that:
[source,java]
-----------------
  A[0] = -3
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 2
  A[3] = -2
  A[4] = 5
  A[5] = 6
-----------------
contains the following example triplets:
[source,java]
-----------------
(0, 1, 2), product is −3 * 1 * 2 = −6
(1, 2, 4), product is 1 * 2 * 5 = 10
(2, 4, 5), product is 2 * 5 * 6 = 60
-----------------
Your goal is to find the maximal product of any triplet.

Write a function:
[source,java]
-----------------
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
-----------------

that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A, returns the value of the maximal product of any triplet.

For example, given array A such that:
[source,java]
-----------------
  A[0] = -3
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 2
  A[3] = -2
  A[4] = 5
  A[5] = 6
-----------------
the function should return 60, as the product of triplet (2, 4, 5) is maximal.

Assume that::

N is an integer within the range [3..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000..1,000].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).


* https://github.com/sunilsoni/Codility-Practice/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codility/lessons/Sorting/NumberOfDiscIntersections.java[*Number Of Disc Intersections:*] Compute the number of intersections in a sequence of discs.

We draw N discs on a plane. The discs are numbered from 0 to N − 1. A zero-indexed array A of N non-negative integers, specifying the radiuses of the discs, is given. The J-th disc is drawn with its center at (J, 0) and radius A[J].

We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J ≠ K and the J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point (assuming that the discs contain their borders).

The figure below shows discs drawn for N = 6 and A as follows:
[source,java]
-----------------
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 5
  A[2] = 2
  A[3] = 1
  A[4] = 4
  A[5] = 0
-----------------

There are eleven (unordered) pairs of discs that intersect, namely:

discs 1 and 4 intersect, and both intersect with all the other discs;
disc 2 also intersects with discs 0 and 3.
Write a function:
[source,java]
-----------------
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
-----------------

that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of (unordered) pairs of intersecting discs. The function should return −1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000.

Given array A shown above, the function should return 11, as explained above.

Assume that:: 

N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2,147,483,647].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
